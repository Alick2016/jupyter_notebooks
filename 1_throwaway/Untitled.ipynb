DESPITE THE CAR HAVING LESS THAN 20,000 MILES AND ORIGINAL TIRES, I WAS SURPRISED HOW BADLY THE TIRES PERFORMED IN MILD SNOWY CONDITIONS.  I MADE A MENTAL NOTE TO GET NEW TIRES, ALTHOUGH QUITE DISAPPOINTED THAT I FELT THAT NEED WITH A RELATIVELY NEW CAR  UNFORTUNATELY, THE NEXT SNOW HIT BEFORE I BOUGHT NEW TIRES.  I WAS IN MY OWN NEIGHBORHOOD, A FEW BLOCKS FROM MY HOUSE, MAKING MY WAY TO A MAJOR STREET WITH A MILD DECLINE.  THE ROAD WAS SLICK, BUT I NOTED THAT THE OTHER CARS DID NOT SEEM TO HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY STOPPING, ETC.  AS I BEGAN THE DESCENT DOWN THE HILL, I NOTICED MY TIRES WERE NOT GIVING MY ANY TRACTION, AND I BEGAN SLIDING UNCONTROLLABLY DOWN THE HILL.  I COLLIDED WITH A CAR ON THE INTERSECTING STREET DUE TO, I BELIEVE, VERY POOR TIRE PERFORMANCE.  A NEW CAR OF THIS CALIBER, IN MY OPINION,SHOULD HAVE ADEQUATE TRACTION ABILITY FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST 20,000 MILES.  MY CAR IS, LIKELY TOTALED, I AM INJURED, THE OTHER PARTY'S CAR IS BADLY DAMAGED AND I IMAGINE SHE SUFFERED INJURIES AS WELL.  I AM DEEPLY DISAPPOINTED IN THE PERFORMANCE OF THIS VEHICLE.

      "2016,HONDA,PILOT,20160321,SERVICE BRAKES,\"I MOVED CAR OUT OF DRIVEWAY SO FRIEND COULD LEAVE GARAGE. WHEN I WENT TO PUT CAR BACK IN DRIVEWAY, THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP AND HIT THE CAR IN OTHER SIDE OF GARAGE.  WHEN I PUT THE CAR IN REVERSE TO MOVE AWAY FROM CAR/GARAGE THE CAR WOULD NOT STOP IN REVERSE.  I TURNED THE WHEEL TO PREVENT CAR FROM HITTING TRUCKS IN DRIVEWAY ACROSS THE STREET I HIT NEIGHBORS MAILBOX AND BROKE TAIL LIGHT AND LEFT A PAINT SCRATCH ALONG ENTIRE DRIVER SIDE OF VEHICLE.  I CALLED A TOW TRUCK DRIVE WHO SAID THERE WAS SOMETHING WRONG WITH CAR BRAKES WHEN HE MOVED CAR TO BED OF HIS TRUCK.  HE USED EMERGENCY BRAKE TO STOP CAR.   THE HONDA DEALER I HAD THE CAR TOWED TO WAS IN MYRTLE BEACH, SC. THE TECH SAID HE RAN ALL THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND DID NOT FIND ANYTHING EXCEPT AN AC ISSUE.  THE AREA SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE ALSO TESTED THE CAR AND SAID IT WAS \"\"SAFE TO DRIVE\"\".  I DID DRIVE IT TO RALEIGH LATER IN THE WEEK AND THEN HOME TO CHANTILLY VA.  I HAVE HAD NO REPEAT ISSUES BUT I AM VERY CAUTIOUS WHEN I APPLY THE BRAKES AT A LOW SPEED FOR A STOP SIGN OR RED LIGHT.  \",Y,N,,,N,Y\n",
