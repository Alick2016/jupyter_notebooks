      "But you make it hard for me to hold back :-)\n",
      "I didn't hear this msg come thru. I am reading now tho\n",
      "That isny a question Daniel ?\n",
      "Was it suppose to be?\n",
      "Oh. Oops. I read it wrong. I was thinking that you said you had to ask me a question but you didn't. What you said was that you wanted to tell me something\n",
      "And I actually have a question about that if you have a minute for you close your eyes\n",
      "Ok\n",
      "Are you telling me that our not being able to actually fallow thru with \"making Love\" is because of what you just told me and.. that you purposely put us in that position of not physically being able to start and complete the act ?\n",
      "Well.. \n",
      "Ok, u must have fallen out. \n",
      "Hmmm no that is not what happened, the former is what i believe is what is called performance anxiety i think, the latter i don't know what you're taking about\n",
      "I am going to msg u some stuff here in a bit, u will have a lil bit of somethings to read after u wake & get rdy in thw morning. Hope it won't wake u. \n",

      "Ah\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "I was just reading this again to make sure I understood what u said. \n",
      "Ok I'm gonna call now, but only for just a cpl mins. I do Not want to keep u from your sleep \n",
      "Oh and also, I know that I make it hard for you to hold back. I do everything that I do.. on this topic, so that you feel as if you can't hold back, so that I am completely irresistible to you. That you are fully desiring me & are fully into to me, us & the moment that you have no room for anything else to be present with us right then during those moments\n",
      "But if what you are expressing is how you truely feel, then I respect that. And I can put forth effort to do the same and not make it difficult for yoy or us both to hold back\n",

      "It is not that for me tho\n",
      "It isn't about missing the touch of another and/or getting heated up. It hasn't even rlly been about being excited, turned on, arroused, pleasured, pleased. Hasn't been about a climax or any self gratification of my ability to please you & seeing you pleased by me, pleased by my body & by my actions.  It hasn't been about \"the physical act\". It was always all about You.. just You. To be all honest, I have spent the last 5 years learning how not to miss Sex. I used to be a Very sexual person. Sex was important in my life & somewhat too important at times. So (even tho.. life should be ideal the opposite) sex has no certian space in my life at all. I assume that one day in my future it will be a part of my life, lifestyle,  routine etc. I hope that it will at some point and I have faith that it will happen but it has no priority and I have no void that needs filled by sex. When I decided\n",
      "(The rest of this little \"Love Letter\" to you from me, written electronically via SMS ;) )Daniel, I have no problems sitting Sex on the way side until the time is more appropriate. Thank you for being so considerate towards me. Thank you for caring SO much about me that you selflessly protect my future feelings of situations that may never even happen. Thank you for going as far as using caution to help in silently reassuring me of your sincerity and true intentions toward me.  One of the things that is So Beautiful about what it is that we have together is.. the way this strength of attraction towards one another & the Feelings that have been built thus far.. seem to be almost perfectly egual.~ Ya know Daniel, I rlly truely have much admiration & respect for you (yes I def do know that you are NOT perfect.. but) You are a Good Man & a Great Guy!! There is no way for me to place my attraction towards you, is no way for me to explain it, I do not have the words. What I do know, that matters is that it is REAL, as it Grows.. it continues to be More Genuine & Natural than Anything that I have ever  expirenced in Life before there was You. I am a Lucky Woman to have you Daniel. To me You are Perfect ♡.. even including any flaws, scars & imperfections that are a part of you. Since we have met and gradually as we come to know one another more & more and as we gain feelings, there is a Calm and a Peace that has taken a place in my life and it is filling void that has ever been empty. This I needed,  and it is You that brings this into my Life. So I guess that, maybe I needed you in my Life Daniel !?! I do hope that this letter touched you in places that feelings didn't use to reside. I hope that you felt my words as you read them and that they painted a smile on Your face. I hope that in reading this, you felt rlly Great inside, that you felt the value of your worth & that you could feel for a Moment, just how Very very Special that you are. ~Am Keeping You !♡!.. ~Annie\n",
      "(Btw that last msg reached the exact maximum amt of characters aloud >LOL) and just WOW!! I about crapped when we hung up and I seen what time that it was :( :( :( damn it me!! Ive Been a bit selfish lately and your sleep & focus are suffering because of me, yes I know you have a part in it, but still) I rlly am sorry that you are falling behind. Did you know that It is fact though, that this is part of the cycle, of changes that take place on the life's of 2 ppl that meet and begin the process of ~falling for each other~ ?!?.. So at least there is that ♡ ;) ♡ I will be thinking of You Daniel. Hope you Have a productive & Great day despite your lack of sleep. Talk soon. XO ~Annie\n",

      "Hi Sweetness, thx for msg. Yeah, this smoking thing is very tough atm but i am hanging in there. It is the BIGGEST thing on my mind, almost consuming all other thoughts that are trying to make their way thru to be productive. UUGH! I am tyring hard to flush my mind of the Discusting habit. Ive yet to walk over to the Drive Thru & purchase a pack & And Ive been listening to the neighbor guy go outside & smoke & cough about every 20 mins. So I am DEF Staying Strong & holding Will Power. YAY 4 Me!!\n",

I am positive that your morning has been very busy and you are lagging so Once things slow down for you a little later today and you have a chance to read it > I believe that you are rlly going to enjoy it, at least I am rlly hoping that it make you feel Great within and that it may even feel a bit empowering. Hoping you can stay attentive and productive thru this lack of sleep & jolted schedule that you have going on <3 Talk Soon  =Annie\n",
      "Yeah i was feeling really groggy this morning so didn't read your book.  But just got done reading it during my break.  It was awesome reading that and I am glad you have expressed your thoughts to me.  I love that about you.  :-)\n",

      "Interesting enough, most often it takes quite awhile before I even start opening up, even in the smallest amounts.. to other ppl (Not meaning only men but rather-Everyone ~Potential date type of men, women in friendship, other mothers, my already exsisting family members, professional ppl that help aid me in my needs to make it thru this recovery, old friends from school or the military) U name it, it has been mostly pretty difficult for me, to allow myself to build close, intimate relationships with ppl in general.  & if it for some reason it seemed as if it wasnt very difficult & happened quicker than usual> Then I usually would end up, emotionally running & hiding from said person & then shutting down from them until there is no type of relationship left at all to exsist~Being that I rlly wasn't ready nor at the point that I should have or could have been comfortable opening up.. As either the comfort level was fabricated by Myself & Or I was rightly feeling unwanted & undeserved  pressure from the other party. Pressure to share of who I am, share my thoughts & feelings & pressure to trust them, as if trusting them was just something that I \"was just supossed to do\" & if I wasn't jumping to display trust & expressed any reservations at all, the they were the ones claiming to feel \"hurt, cheated & belittled\" ◇ SO The GOOD News is that I am not who I used to be, am not who I once was & that I have gradually made progression despite the odds surrounding me. And the GREAT News is This.. \n",
      "I have opened up to you like a Damn Champ !! & I have done so & at a decent pace too.  Why ? 1. Cause I finally feel like I am rdy. 2. I know it is safe with you.. that I am safe with you. 3. You make it so easy. ♡Your calming, accepting, demeanor. You're unmistakably kind & unjudgemental. Your ability to listen, to sympathize & to empathize. With time, age has brought U wisdom Daniel .

So I saved what I typed to you on my S Memo so u could finish it in a bit n send it but THEN, I got side tracked tryna   saved tweet somethings in my PC that would clean it up and improve its pregormance, THEN (lol) I ended up in microsoft word, working on this document that is important to me. Was just about finished with it when u just now msgd me. \n",
      "U see this no smoking g thing is a bit vicious, trying anything to keep my head clear of anything that had to do with smoking & It seems that part of that is overwhelming myswlf all at once with so many diff things that my mind it too busy tryna figure out wich one I am supossed to be working on, to spend much time noticing that I am lacking nicotine and a habit.\n",

As the first thought that came to mind is how big of a weight was lifted off og your family today.. for now AND I could just picture how happy you must be right in these moments. . I drifted off in my mind to my other world where things are a little more of the way they should be. I could've jumped to also suggest a celebration & share in your happiness with you, because in that ideal place, my situation with my truck would have been all in order at this time & I could have jumped on the road and came to celebrate with you guys or met you somewhere Great. OR  =you and I would have been living nearer to one another. & this all could be a piece of cake.. with icing on top ;)\n",

I slept that heavy that night and I snore like that because I'm sleeping so heavy because I really almost literally got no sleep that night before you came. And as for the noises I'm not sure what you mean if they're like little moaning noises as I do do that but not probably not to the extent that I did that night because cuz I was so exhausted and tired that night it was probably exaggerated if it's different noises and not to let me know because I'm like I might be just a lil confused LOL \n",

They are some of the letters that i spoke of, written by my Doctor. My Doctor is a Vital accet in my lifer\n",
      "oops\n",
      "they were written By my Doc with his opinions of me, as a mother, as an individual & as someone working hard to get thru a recovery process. Everytime he would write a etter for me when needed I would get so excite to read the things that he had to say about me. Ofcourse, he is always very honest as he is a good man and these are medical opinions so altho there were some things that he would say that were not exactly what i wanted to hear, i wanted to hear it all as i could not work on my faults and weaknesses that still exsisted had i  not known they were there. These letters are VERY important to me and the LLY mean A Lot to me. as there are noy yoo many ppl in my life that actually rlly know me. When i read Toms words it is VERY meaningful to me because Tom knows me better than anyone else and better than anyone else ever has. Because of this he is one of the only ppl that sees me\n",
      "that is the a huge part of why these letters (and my Dr ofcourse) mean So much to me and are So important to me. Tom sees within me, he sees just how beautiful I am, he sees my strength, my honesty, Sincerity, will power. he knows the extent of my Love as a mother. He believes in me and never gives up on me and never will, and not because it is his job. it is rlly about a trusting relationship between two ppl. he isnt tere for me because he is my doctor and because he treats me. He is always there for me because he believes in me. it may almost seem sad from the outside looking in, that the one person that i trust more than anyone else in life is my shrink. the one person that knows mw qithin and sees who i rlly am is my shrink & that others (such as family etc) that were supossed to be the ones ther for me, having faith in me, witnessing my strength, endurance and intelligence and\n",
      "feel No shame. I have such a vast respect and admiration for this man, as a person way more than as a doctor. so for me it is an honor to read words that he has written about me, (& again, yes, even the ones that dont completely speak of progress in some areas where i had hoped that there would have been by then) seeing me at my weakest & witnessing my struggles as Ive worked so diligently and refused to give up \n",
      "Most of my life, at least all of my life while ive been completely present,, fully me and not in moments where i felt confused. I have trived for constuctive critisism. ive always taken much pride in my ability to appriciate and grasp the constuctive critisism, even when it came from angels that i was tempted to feel hurt instead of an even stronger desire to  be the best woman that i possible could. So along with all the wonderful things that Tom does see in me because he actually knows me. Along with his Faith and belief in me, the other things that he has to say about me, i appriciate just as much and I Thank God and am Greatful that i have him in my Life for so so many reasons. yes as a doctor but on a personal level as well. as the support system that i have never had yet also as some one helping me to recognize my own flaws when i didnt have the ability to do so myself. If Tom had\n",
      "i am not entirely positive that i would have found the strength and ability to discover all that was beneath the surface of who i am, that this Beautiful woman and Amazing person and individual exsisted in me. there are so many people in this world that do not get accurate medical care, many people often end up with Crap doctors with a good degree and those doctors end up failing their patients  far mor than they ever help them heal. I say this in every medical aspect, physical as well as mental. (for me they are all one in the same and all steming from the human anatomy and physiology) many Lives in this world that  have been lost very wel could have been saved under the hands and guidence of a GOOD Doctor. I never forget to be Greatful that Tome was placed in my lifes path and in the timing that he was. when your life in in the midst of the balance between life and death and the most\n",
      "could save your life at that challanging turning point in your life. a Doctor, his expertise and passion for his job could hold your fate. Actually, you know what i am talking about and where i am coming from, all too well you know. <3 My point is that I was Blessed at a time when I truely needed it most and as for the rest of the work, that was and is on me. I was just given the correct tool to assist me. that tool being Tom.\n",
      "Yes you were very fortunate to have Tom in your life.  I hope you also address physical ailments that u might have and also address your nicotine addiction.  Tom helped u with your mental ailments, but I hope you stay on top of your physical issues too.  I know you have been and can imagine it is so difficult to stay on top of just your mental issues alone, and then on top of that, your physical issues.  That is so much to try to be on top of for one person!  I feel sorrow for u and I know u dont want sorrow from me but I cant help it, I am human after all and have heart.\n",
      "So Daniel, I would like you to understand my reasoning for  sharing these letters with you. Besides the many many reasons I would have wanted to share this part of myself and my life with you eventually anyway. I am not sure how this will come out sounding via typing thru a text But my reasons for sharing them arent even really about my medical issues, post or those that are still present. I wanted to share with you because they speak volumes of who i am, what kind of a person I am and what kind of a person I am not. They paint a very raw and naked picture of ME, the  =Elizabeth Ann Williams = that you met. the words in these letters during the times and situations that they were written, Spotlight my Brilliance and Strength but at the same time Expose who i have been and who i am when At my weakest points and in the face of Great Adversity. the last of the most important reason i am going to mention of ehy i wanted to share these personal writings with you is this...\n",
      "wait.\n",
      "you havent gotten to read the letters yet but you will see that there is mention in there there of physical ailments and treatments that need atten or have  gotten attn and healing. When i speak of my life neing at speak and that i was Greatful to be in the hands of good medcial care.. I wasn not just speaking of issues that have to do with depression, anxiety, PTSD.. the mental aspects. when Tom speaks of me being on the brink of death when I sought him out for help that final time in 2011 (and still under his care) He was not speaking of my condition being that dire and drastic due ultimately to the mental health issues at hand he was was actually speaking of physical health. condtion was  where it was due to ther gradual effects of the mental health help that i needed and wasnt yet aware of. But it wwas my body that was about to fail me, not my brain, my mind, chemistry or faulty\n",
      "both physically and mentally. that is part of common practice oin the medical profession, it is an area where you can not have just pay atten to one and ignore the other. My treatment has been quite in depth so much so that there would be no way to make it the a recovery for the issue that was at hand with out paying a Great  amount of attn to physical health at the same time.\n",
      "Yeah that makes sense, often they come hand in hand\n",
      "yes it is also in scripture, the balance of attn & care to mental and physical health\n",
      "Since u trust Tom, would Tom be ok with u dating again?  Not sure if you told him or if you got his blessing beforehand.\n",
      "and btw, i have to be honest with you here, any issue that i deal with concerning nicotine is so minor in the grand aspect of it all. with all that i have had to concour and bounce back from. in all of this.. the work was mine and up to me. Nicotine is a sideline issue that is something that i can take contol of and continue to focus on the bigger issues that i need assisting with. An.. you do not rlly know me so you may not know that (althou you do pretty much understand that i am a very honest person) there isnt anything that i do not share with tom and address with him. a person who is sincere about improving their life can not do so and is only wasting theri own time if they are not honest and forthright with the Dr that is treating them \n",
      "Yes definitely nicotine is relatively minor.\n",
      "yes. and i am on day 3 as a non smoker. I am completely amazed with myself, i never have handled quiting so well and i was worried that this would be the most difficult quit ive faced yet.\n",
      "Yeah in the big picture, in the totality of all your issues, nicotine addiction is a minor issue to what u deal with.  But perhaps look at it as a low hanging fruit.\n",
      "That is awesome Annie!\n",
      "Daniel, as I was finishing off saying a cpl messaegs ago, me speaking to you about sharing these letters and actually sharing the letters with you is not even rlly about the medical issues, not mental not physical.\n",
      "Yup I know, I know u intend to reveal the reasoning behind you sharing the letters.\n",
      "yes. and i did reveal why I wanted to share that personal part of me with you, all but the last sentence of my reasoning, i was about to type that when you had msged me.\n",
      "(btw i am at my comp typing these texts otherwise ther in NO WAY that i could ever spit this so fast :0) )\n",
      "U have my email right?\n",
      "this is about me, who i am as a person and me sharing that with you. you mentioned & we talked about this,  that we had covered the basis of medical issues and so it was out in the open so we were at a comfort level in the aspect of honesty there. & you also expressed with that that you would like to stil that aside for a bit and get to actually know me and us know each other. I agreed and so that was my intent as well. and with that i figured when there was a point that you wanted to talk to me concerning medical issues ive faced and am yet to finish hurdleing, then you would bring it up to me at that time. i like your idea and was out to respect your request. the imprtant part was over, i was leaving you no room to doubt me as an honest person. it sucks that i have to jump into some uncomfortable personal subjects to get things out on the table in the biginning but at the same time,\n",
      "also in my favor, it brings to light to me as well, rather or not you will at that point choose to see me for who i am and get to know me on an equal level or if knowing some of those most intimate details of my life, you end up viewing me in a different way. Even tho you may not intend to. kind of how you mentioned that you feel sorrow for me and you had mentioned in the past a cpl things, such as you had an impression that i was looking for someone to fix me. and i can not recall the other one atm. Maybe you do not not see me any different and if so Hopefully you will not view me in different ways without realizing it before it has happened.\n",
      "there is are many aspects of volnerability haveing to find strength to overcome and hel thru such things as i have faced. Once aspect of volnerabilty is after you have shared you basically have exposed your soul in the most naked aspect as it can get and in that one of the things that can often happen is that instead of being seen for who your rlly are, for your individuality, intense drive and the astonishing amount of inner strength, endurance and drive that it has taken you to face and accept when you are handed an illness unexpectedly, to have made it where you have Because you chose to and youve worked hard and fought witj every fiber in your being to come out in the end as Something truely Amazing while never stopping to consider the option of giving up.\n",
      "(yes i have email. I actually am heqading out the door shortly, as i have an appointment that i have to go to. I Definetly did not expect to send you but one text to state that i was going to send and share the letters and why, but as i discovered andd should have known it wasnt that simple not to mention that i seem to have this habit of trying to say one thing to you and in that i end up opening up to you seeimingly almost as much as i can.) U will not find me attempting to send you a simple text from my PC like this again and then end up typing you texts for over an hour straight, lol that just has to be a bit redicualas coming thru and blowing up your phone. :)\n",
      "Dang Annie, you're hilarious!\n",
      "and yes, we agree thatr in the big picture Nicotine addition is a minor issue to deal with and as for considering looking at is as a low hanging fruit... Well, it sure is a Good thing that ive recognized it as an addiction issue, accepted it, claimed it, chose to act on correcting it and am nipping it in the butt and getting it out of the way. Tom knows that i picked cigerettes up again a few months back. today i was actually considdering texting him and letting him know that i am on day three and Super Excited about it and Proud of myself. I know that he will be proud of me too and he also will not be suprised that i chose to do something abu /out smoking, now sooner than later. because he knows me well and he knows that is the kind of person tat i am. I do not find reason to consider it a low hanging fruit. i dont see a point in it.\n",
      "I DO however intend on contnueing to strive and to stick to this goal and achive it. I aim to keep telling myself how proud i am nad that I can do this, i will continue to count how many days and hours of i have gotten each time i find myself thinking of the habit. and also reminding myself how much longer it to me this time ro realize that i havent had a smoke and how the amount of time between noticing is getting longer between stretches. That right there is the biggest sign that you are in fact suceeding in overcoming the addiction and coming out on top. THAT is Exciting. That is something Huge to be self prideful over. something to Brag about to anyone and everyone who knows you.\n",
      "Yes thats an awesome accomplishment and should be something to be proud of\n",
      "i Know these things, ive been here before. I Quit at least 50 times before i had my final quit in 2007.  This issue here. i will not claim it asa fail to have become a smoker again that has to quit 50 more times before i QUIT. I stumbled in the midst of bad cercumstances that surronded me.. i fell back a few steps. I pick up. i fix it and i move on to bigger things. I know what i am capable of and i am forthright with my doctor, so to spend time analizing it or seeing any low hanging fruit is not something that i feel that i need. i have to be greatful that i can still find the inner strength and will power to grasp this while handling so many of the bigger issues that  are vital atm.. & being, just to name a cpl, several different issues i am dealing with the courts with, getting my driving situation straightened out so that i can have my truck back on the road and get to the appts i\n",
      "able to get from point A to point B on the road again so that i can be there for my children. Ive also a priority of the different otions to look into to generate and secure more funds to meet my financial needs and establish a financial stability that will not leave me concerned about money as that kind of tress and struggle only takes away from the healing process and I want this Recovery process Over. I want to Live life Rlly rlly LIVE Life. i am so done with this and done with obsticles that leave me feeling as if i am stagnant for periods of time.. These are a Few of the Bigger issues that leave me handing the smaller ones such as cigerettes, on my own. so I have less that gets in my way of what i am trying to accomplish. I am Just Done, Done being the sick one that noone wants to get close to, that syblings avoid, that has to bare her naked soul and most humiliating moments in her\n",
      "fairness and upfront honesty. and this is what has to be done and is the way that i have to start my socializing and social interations, if i do not want to  (when very much feels like) just sit, stored away on some wooden box somewhere alone not being able to come out until every scar and even smallest nic and cut is healed and bandages removed. Not being able to het to share smiles and laughs with others, getting to trust and allowing others to trust me. Not having the fair chance at sharing common affection & human touch with a man and being loved after falling in love and having been fallen for. Shit has happend in my life and that me and in many ways, for my chilfren, has been unfortunate. and it Sucks. but what has happened to me, what ive brought on by wrong choices and all that i never asked for at all, it Does Not.. make up who i am. My Strength, destermination and will to not\n",
      "point it often feels similar as to if i were being punished for what i do not understand that i have done wrong. like a child who does not get to mingle with the other children until what? that child ends up feeling convinced as if she does not deseerve to mingle in the company of the other children, the other children that she sees in her eyes as the same and equal to her? that she dosent get the right to build bonds and be appriciated for all of the beautiful things within her that noone sees because she is always in a time out.\n",
      "i have to head out to my appt. but to quickly finish what i was trying to express to you earlier.. (oh..lol AND Thank God for that as your phone will stop being flooded with text messages.. I truely promise i will not do this again. I do not feel rediculas for typing for you for the last 2 hours but i do feel very silly fot getting cought up in it via a keyboard overloading a cell phone :( Bwahaha ;) )\n",
      "well shit. i coped the last part of what i was saying erlier. and it was the end and now i go to paste it and there is nothing there so...\n",
      "Annie, this is so much to digest and surprised my phone didnt die ;-)   Seriously,  I do understand the gist of what you're trying to say.  I do admire you for who you really are.\n",
      "Daniel, the letters are a raw and naked painting of ME, Who i really am, the me the dosent get seen because ive had things happen in my life and ppl see them as too overwhelming  before that even see the worth behing ME. and/or the are aware that i have endured various different obsticles in life and so they (at times without realizing it) see me as weak and/or as lesser, not as equal as them. as you have stated at differnt times, you were nder the impression that i was looking for someone to save me, your feel sorrow for me. and there was something else i cant recall. Can you see ME when you get to know ME? do you think that you could get cought up in viewing me different without realizing that you are doing so? those letters speak of an \"Elizabeth Ann Williams\" >Me. Her strength determination and her will to continue to strive and fight for a healthy Life while staring in the face of\n",
      "mother possible. while she will do all she can to seek resolve in her life while never stopping once to even consider giving up. that doing the Right thing always the type of person that she has chosen to be even when she has to fight even harder at times because of that.\n",
      "Tom mentions at diff times, diff areas in which i was still yet weak while also expressing his complete faith of what i am capable of and where he, without a doubt, sees me in life as a healthy recovered individual who gives back more than whe ever would have been able to before. He also speaks of his admiration for me and the amount of strength i have and how determined of a woman i am. Point is that, yeah Tom is a Dr. but he is a DAMN Good one, one of the best. Tom knows me better than anyone else in this world. he is able to rly see Me. the Me that that other people nnever get to see because the do not attempt it with enough effort.. they mis out on all that i am. and I Shine !! i have to gp \n",
      "point was is that i wanted u to read what the one person that knows me more than anyone has to say when he speaks of me. that is all. this wasnt anything about anything to do eith \"sick\" or Illness\" etc\n",

      "I know, i am interested in those letters.  I want to know my Annie. :-)\n",
      "I want u to know I dont think of u as a lesser human than me.  As I said earlier when we spoke, u didn't ask to have these unfortunate things to happen to you.  This isnt your fault.  In many aspects u are a much stronger and wiser person than me.  I admire u .  I see u as a woman who wants to be the best mom.  I also see a good woman who can love, provide joy and laughter.  You have with me.  Those letters I am certain will validate what I am already seeing in you.\n",
      "Hey Daniel I just got home from appt, I heard ur msgs come thru but I've not read them yet. I want to apologize for earlier. while searching for the words to try to express my thoughts I ended up rambling, talking in circles while stating alot of the same things more than once but just wording it differently. That was not the first time I have rambled to you while searching for the right words to express to u what it was that I was thinking and feeling. It is frustrating & I find it embarassing when I do that. I am def embarassed about my earlier rambling :( I am actually  almost hesitant to read the msgs that you sent me.. I am sure that I seemed Overwhelming & yes, I am rlly that embarassed over it. I started thinking about it and I think I was able to make sense of why that is happening, the searching for words, getting frustrated & then rambling. I can share that with u if u like. Btw I am on my phone atm, so no worries of the flooding texts\n",
      "Ill be leaving work in about 10 mins, can I call u then?\n",
      "Earlier I was going thru some files on my PC & I came across Tom's letters, I used the text app to let you know that I was going to send them, what they were and why. I so type quite quickly & I use FB msgr alot & while becoming frustrated from trying to figure out how to express myself correctly, I failed to remember that I was using a text app to send to your phone & that I wasn't on FB msgr like I am used to & by that time I had rlly blew the living hell out of your phone.. OMG!!\n",
      "Daniel, TY for thw offer to callI actually have to make 2 quick phone calls before the close of business & then I am going to hop in the shower & wash off. Plz be safe on your way home? And forgive me for my silliness earlier?\n",

      "ok thanks just read the 5 pages of memos\n",
      "Tell u the truth, i don't think the 5 pages really reveal much other than to indicate you have DID and made much progress.  The most recent memo was dated July 23, 2012.  I'm not sure what I was suppose to get out these 5 pages.  But I'm glad Dr Holmes think you've made much progress.\n",
      "I think that you are more different than you realize you are. You may think that I am over estimating you but I am Not Daniel. People with qualities  & a belief system such as yours are few and far between. Rare actually. You see, I've not had people like you in my life, all people in general & I  especially Never had a man such as yourself, in my life.  I had hoped to have found a \"Daniel\" but I never did. I had takers in my life. They were Selfish. They had no Faith in me at all & doubted me in most everyway possible. Somewhere in all of that they also tore me down & it seems that I had let them do so. In these years I've spent alone & getting to know myself, looking back, I see now, what I was not able to understand then. Maybe this helps to explain to you why it is that you & the kind of man that you are are almost \"Foriegn\" to me. I think about you often and I literally have to\n",
      "Awww thanks Annie.  I know I am a good person.  But I do think there are good people.  Just not in your immediate area.  With that said though, I know I have much to offer to a woman or any person.  I myself am very selective as to who I involve myself.  I've dated a few times since my divorce.  The women I've dated, although generally good people, actually used me for sex.  For most men, it would be an ego boost, right?  But for me, it did have a negative impression on me.  It probably doesn't surprise you since you know this about me. For me, it made want to not have sex with someone until I truly love and feel comfortable with that person and for me to know the person loves me also.  For me, the sex is enjoyable when 2 people truly love each other.  To me sex and love is a symbiotic relationship.  So you are right, I am like a woman in that way LOL!\n",
      "Earlier today I think that I may have been a bit rough on you and you dis not deserve that. I sincerely apologize to you. There was nothing that you did. I've been playing it all over in my head & there was something that was triggering to me & after that I become a little lost and when you would say something to me I heard it in a way that everything in my past  that was to to me, about me, was meant. (Example, U told me that you genuinely felt sarrow for me. What I heard from you is that you were speaking less of me & in a way of mockery. ) In a way, I lashed back at you. After my appt today I was trying to make sense of myself earlier. I know that I had gotten confused & in that confusion I Failed to remember who you are and also who you are not. so.. \n",
      "Annie, I know due to your past experiences, it would be hard not to extrapolate those experiences onto me.  I know you will probably still have that inner worry of me abandoning you, rejecting you.  But Annie, as we spoke earlier.  I have accepted your conditions, your past mistakes.  I don't hold those things against you or think any less of you.  It is what it is.  You did not ask for all that shit you went through.  But make no mistake, you and I will face challenges.  It won't be easy.\n",
      "I don't know if you if know this about me, but I don't think much about the future.  My experience with my son's cancer and my atheistic belief do not lend itself to think about the future.  I don't worry about you and I in the future.  I just want to live for the moment and be good to the people I love and care about. Life is already tough for normal people.  There is no heaven or hell that awaits me.  When I die, I am just dead.  Part of the earth.  My remains will rot, the atoms that once made up my biological being will be re-used again to feed the future living. So in that sense, I do live forever.  In physics, we are taught, matter is neither created or destroyed.  So it will be that I am forever part of this universe.  My love for you will be until I die.\n",
      "You have expressed this to me in the past. So yes, I somewhat already understand this about you. You did not explain it then with the detail that you did just now and ofcourse, then the part at the end, that included me was not part of it either\n",
      "I am rlly glad that you shared that with me again and in a more expressive way. You a very interesting and I enjoy learning about you, as much about you as I can. \n",

      "and about the L word.  I do.  I am sorry I have not spoken those 3 sacred words to you.  I would rather my actions reveal that and the other reason is I do not want to rush things.\n",

      "that back pain will be your most pressing physical issue, i think Annie, I worry about it\n",
      "next will be sciatica\n",
      "Yeah ok. So I can't bend over n pick things up, move things I am moving about like I am 90. And ok I can handle that but is something else\n",
      "shit annie, that sucks, really\n",
      "My left leg keeps losing feeling because of the pinched nerve. It goes out on me from under me. \n",
      "that is the sciatic nerve probably\n",
      "Like paraphelegic no feeling. I can handle alot, but I've never been completely alone all of the time while trying to maintian with an issue such as that. \n",
      "shit annie that is serious\n",
      "please annie, can we try to get u an appt?\n",
      "I have 2 herniated disks in the very lower back and yes, the nerve gets pinched when it gets bad like this I lose lower limb control and get nerve jolts that feel like electric shock\n",
      "so surgery is the only way to fix, and you dont' want to do that, right?\n",
      "What kind of appt do I get. I am not rlly sure where to start, do I go to the orthopedic clinic that evaluated me a cpl of years ago ? \n",
      "but then i guess you'd be bed ridden and no1 would take care of you??\n",
      "i don't know, usually I thought you see your main family doc and then he refers you to specialist\n",
      "I get reevaluated every three years to make sure no more disks have moved and check the condo of the 2 already and the degenerated disk desiese.\n",
      "Right right, is prolly how that works. \n",
      "you need me to take you to see doc or u have someone who can?\n",
      "There are all sorts of treatments for pain control, 2 years ago when I seen ortho the doc told me that it wasn't to the point to consider surgery BUT he is the first and only Dr that ever told me that and he was rlly an arrogant pick who didn't even look at me, he glances at my mri. Zipped out of the room and rushed me off\n",
      "i don't just taking pain meds wll do any good if your nerves are truly getting pinched or worse, severed\n",
      "It is scary at times when is like this. Last night I wasn't sure what to do. I contimplated the ER but that can't do anything for me & would prolly assume I am a drug seeker and I don't want their pain meds. Pain isn't the issue, I am used to the pain. \n",
      "im sorry Annie, i don't want to be an alarmist or worry u, i think to be safe, u should at least have an opinion from a doctor\n",
      "No, they rlly don't effect the pain anyhow,  I've just been spinning it thru my head if I were alone and I fell, fell down the stairs, fell and hit my head and noone is here or will be coming here.\n",
      "It used to o ly get this bad bout once every uear, year & a half but it is happening more rapidly now\n",
      "No no. U are right. I am getting a bit scared and worried. It is going from something that I just live with and tolerate to losing all function of a limb that supports my balance and body weight. \n",
      "let me know what you want to do.  i will try to help as best as i can.  seems like you should at least see a doc and get scans.  docs can't just take what u tell them.  it will def require scans.\n",
      "I make an appt with a family doc get a referral for an ortho n I wait until that appt,.. I was thinking that maybe a chiropractor can help fix me for now? So that I can feel safe and become more mobile while I get to ortho & get scans to figure out how to handle long term  \n",
      "well if you have numbness or nerve related issues, i don't an adjustment gonna help\n",
      "*dont think\n",
      "Right. It has been 2 years so is time for new scans, I keep copies of all of my past scans\n",
      "Olivia will be with me sat morn theu Sunday evening. So I know that I will nor be alone then should I fall.\n",
      "I will call my family doc tomarrow\n",
      "ok good, not sure if you wanted me to visit u this weekend with Oscar.\n",
      "When I got into trouble I did not drive at all until this past June up thru one month ago. I had planned to get back to the other once on the road and start some type of regular treatment but I become consumed with other more pressing issues and I kept putting it off little by little and forgot all about it. As odd as that may sound. Is true.\n",
      "Wait, what ?.. did you just say that ?\n",
      "Not sure if I wanted you to visit me ?? Gtfo. & what does Oscar have to do with visiting me or us being a leader to see one another ?? \n",

      "About the women wearing dresses, No, Sadly, I don't think that many do. I am an exception I guess, I Love my dresses & am all about them. Unless it is winter or too chilly outside I am in a dress always, typically a sun dress. I do not rlly own any shorts, except a cpl pairs that I would have avail to slip on when Billy's friwnds were here & I needed to get out of bed to go to bathroom\n",
      "You look beautiful in a dress\n",
      "Although I think you look beautiful in anything or nothing\n",
      "But in a dress, me likes\n",
      "Dresses are complete comfort, think about it. Every single part of you gets to completely breath. There is something that happens when a woman puts on a dress. No matter how she feels inside or what is going on a dress has this magical way of making a girl feel feminine and Beautiful. I teach Olivia these things. When she is with me she seldom wears anything but a dress unless it is cold out \n",
      "yeah if i were a woman, i think i would want to be in a dress lol\n",
      "Oh haha, u were with me when I got my laundry feom the dryer. Bout 80% of it was all dresses. I am glad that you like them, is the more attractive that you will find me and more often so\n",
      "yes, that is what i like to hear \n",
      "it wont show right on your phone, but this is one of the things I do at work:  \n",
      "i make boring ass charts lol!\n",
      "Rlly tho. If you were a woman wouldn't u want to wear one ? Is often feels like you have nothing on except a small piece of cloth to cover your lady parts & accent your features \n",
      "yeah, strange not a lot of women particularly in their 40s, wear dresses\n",
      "Maybe your mom would be more impressed with me being that I wear dresses religiously ?\n",
      "Lol\n",
      "Ok am looking at link now\n",

      "Oh I have to comment back.\n",
      "this is a word cloud\n",
      "& what a shame women in 40s & up aren't wearing dresses. I am going to sport this body as long as it continues to stay in the shape it has been and wearing a sundress make me feel, younger, cute, sexxy,  vibrant. Unless a woman is finding ways to activly feel attractive and sexxy, she will never ultimately reach actually being Sexxy and attractive. To be it you need to feel it and believe it. That is not going to happen by sitting back and aging\n",
      "im gonna try to figure out how to save our text messages and make a word cloud\n",
      "there is an obesity problem too, so maybe women are self-conscious about that.  men are obese too into their 40s and beyond\n",
      "And on top of that. Let's be honest here. A man rlly does want his lady to keep herself up for him. Is part of pleasing him & making him feel wanted and important. That is imo. As for me I am not going to be sitting on a park bench in granny PA ties and elastic pants. I am going to dress and feel like a lady that isn't aging and I am going to keep myself up so that you will always be liking and desiring what you see when you look at me\n",
      "I beat you to the saving. Yeaterday I made a word doc feom since they started on May 2nd ;)\n",
      "You did?!!!\n",

      "its ok, the way it works, the most used words will be larger\n",
      "We should guess what the most used word is\n",
      "Probably miss haha\n",
      "I actually was going to do that, but I was going to feel you out fi\n",
      "rst and make sure that it was something that you would appriciate. \n",

      "tomorrow baby\n",

      "I wanted to tell u something\n",
      "im all ears with an open heart\n",
      "That intense msg you sent .e about what is important to you, living in 5he moment how you don't think about the future as in plans etc & the while atheist, universe corpse rotting and recycling ... that txt\n",
      "yeah, i know u don't like to hear that\n",
      "Which btw not sure if u did or didn't expect this but I thought that entire text msg was .. Epic ? It was brilliantly intense and I loved it\n",
      "really?\n",
      "Don't like to hear what ?\n",
      "i thought u might be slightly offended\n",
      "because of your faith\n",
      "my sister was\n",
      "not slightly either\n",
      "What you had to say is what you think and how you feel, I do not vote for or against it. Those are yours to own\n",
      "thank you baby\n",
      "No Daniel.\n",
      "You believe what you chose to believe and for whatever reason you believe. We can care for one another, be best friends devote our undying love to one another but that does not mean that we have to believe in the same thing or worship the same God if any God at all \n",
      "I sont think that it is fair to attempt to take that way from another person nor be upset with someone we love and care about because of what they choose to believe\n",
      "yeah both my sister and my ex rejected me because I am an atheist\n",
      "Love is an unconditional al thing that way. and as for religion & belief, we were all givin free will .. which means free\n",
      "Oh ?! .. I am sorry\n",
      "i know u won't reject me because I am an atheist.  although i am open to the existence of God, so maybe I am agnostic\n",
      "I am just an open minded person\n",
      "I think that that is terrible. I won't even get into that issue, not in text. But I think that they were wrong :( \n",
      "I am as well\n",
      "its ok, i still love my sister and we still talk, just not often\n",
      "But here is something about this and you that I find important. \n",
      "(Never would I reject you & def not for how you feel and what you choose to believe) \n",
      "I have had the same thought and view since you first had expressed you view & belief. & it is simple n I want u to know\n",
      "that's good.  i just had bad experience with being rejected by ppl i have loved, my best friend in college rejected me after he went all jesus freak on me\n",
      "3 ppl in my life that I cared or loved very much rejected me over religious, i just don't get it\n",
      " I do not either. That is not Love\n",
      "Actually, \n",
      "You expressed why you have chosen the vies & beliefs that you have and to me that seemed complete logical. You sure are not the first nor last person that will question God & religion when facing family tragidies of those we love and hold most valuable. To me I can empathize and understand why you may feel that way. Also \n",
      "It is completely logical for something traumatic like you faced to cause you to want to question or even turn from God. It happens and it happens all the time\n",
      "It made perfect sense to me. I do not believe (in your case \"not\" believe) the same as you but that does not make it OK for me to tell you that you are wrong.  That is your path \n",
      "yeah i understand.  it is my personal choice and belief.  regardless of who is right or wrong, won't change who i am.  i will love Annie, my sons, my dog, my life, my journey, i will commit to be good and enjoy life as best as i can.\n",
      " I thought to myself that. There may be a day that you choose different or the way that you believe now very well may be the way that you always believe. That child is your son, Noone else was the father that had to endure the pain that you did and stand next to your boy as he went thru what he did, as you went thru it together.  We ate human, we hurt at times we all handle pain, fear, grief in our own ways.\n",
      "You do what you need to do.  I will never believe what it is you believe now but I will support you in what you choose to be right for you and your life. And know that I would never try to take that away from you and nor will I ever hold that against you in anyway or try to force you to change \n",
      "You do not try to change my views and u do not give me grief when I speak of them \n",
      "To me that is respect and respect for one another's individuality\n",
      "i would never try to change your views, it is personal and I would not want to intrude on that.\n",
      "Keeping ones individuality while in a relationship in important and vital. Losing it is toxic and will lead to a failed relationship\n",
      "I know that abouy you already Daniel. \n",
      "Maybe you'll be the one to convince me there is a God \n",
      "There are so so many reasons that bring me to Love and appriciate you. All of the many small  things that adds up, things like that one\n",
      "That though crossed my mind but only in a way in which u may be convinced on your own thru what you see and witness thru me, n my soul, n my spirit. I will not try to put that on you\n",
      " I actually did love the things you said in that text. I found it poetic and  there was much confidence and strength in thw emotion behind all of those words\n",
      "I was taken back for a moment t once I read it and just sat for a second and had to go back and read it again\n",

      "You are The Best Man that I have ever had in my life, that I have ever been out with even. I know this to be true. I won't take that for granted. Be it partly because of some of the things I've been thru in life. And more. But I have a Good thing in front of me. There are very few women who will get to be as lucky as me in finding you. Because there are very few Good men out there like you. I am proud to call you mine and twll anyone and everyone just how good of a man that you are\n",
      "The things that you said bout not making plans. That is how I am. Before you and with you. I don't think about marriage, don't know that I ever will. I don't think of moving in with a man in the future at some point eyc etc. And with you. I enjoy you, I enjoy this. I do not sit and contemplate rather you are going to want to take us to the next level.. and when you are going to want to take us there. You are in my life, I am in yours. That is good enough for me. That other stuff, if those things are going to happen let them happen naturally. Sitting around wondering, waiting,  guessing, expecting, it ruins relationships, that sort of thing could ruin us. If we enjoy one abother and we communicate all of that other stuff won't get in the way. \n",
      "Because ive expressed that everyone in my life has walked away, has left, It may seem as if I fear that you will leave me. But it isn't quite life that. I get that sometimes ppl change or sometimes there are things do happen but life keeps on going, the world keeps spinning and we all have to keep on living. That issue of walking away that I have expressed isn't that at all. I want something real where another person has Faith in me, enough faith that they won't give up on me. I want someone to believe in me and when they say it I want to be able to trust that they mean it I want to be able to see it in how that treat me, in the way that they love me. If 2 ppl are in a clearly unhealthy n toxic relationship somebody is going to need to end it at some Point exsp if they have exhausted all efforts to try to repair and make it work. What I am talking about is not that. I want to live and\n",

      "Awww Annie.  You're too much :-)  You are a good woman.  A woman like no other I have known.  Not saying this because of what you think of me, saying this because I know it to be true.  You happen to have a harmful, terrible past that is of none of your doing and have not asked for.  It doesn't define you, only explains the trouble you have experienced.  Here you are, I know you as a mother who is trying to do right and doing as best as she can as a mother, a woman who want to live life happily, woman who loves and cares immensely and passionately, a talented woman, a woman of many virtues, a fun and beautiful woman on the outside and inside.  I am so glad and fortunate to have you in my life Annie.\n",

      "Part of all of that other stuff about ppl wanting to know rhey are going ro move to thw next lwbel together and feelibg as if there is not way that they can go on withoyt the other. That is co dependancy. I do not want Co dependancy. I will not base my self worth and exsistance apon someone else value and need for me in their life & I do not want someone looking to me in order to think that they believe in themselves I know that I have actually been that person at some point in my past and I am not that girl and will never be again. That is Not Love. That is an unhealthy need. & that is ppl that need to seek help to repair themselves in therapy.\n",

After I get back to his office I will welcome you to an open door during any of my appts. So that if you need any answers or understanding and or on this subject, of me & dating. I will leave the door to that part of my life open to you. I am not request that u come n meet him and sit in for an appt, I am Not.. asking you to go to therapy with me lol. It is similar to me sitting down. With you and twlling you about my recovery etc. If I make that offer open to you, you know that I care about you, how you feel, your comfort level.

They seem like I was just lost then and wanted to feel something & so I convinced myself that I did.

We have BOTH put our self in volnerable situations knowing that we were risking losing the others interest & soley for the sake of wanting to prove to the other that we would never hurt them, giving prooving that we will put how they think & feel before our own need to be comfortable.

Feeling you inside of me raced right to my soul and the very core of my being. During those moments you exsistance.was mine & my exsistance was yours. Daniel, I used to claim that I knew what it felt like to make love to someone. As I believed that I had expirenced making love to another but had never expirenced Love being made to me. I had hoped to, at some point in my life time, have that expirence. Tonight I expirenced just that & tonight also made me realize that I never had made love to another person.

It is as if I had to wait & wait.. for 42 years while I roamed this world aimlessly,  fighting a war that is logged in no books, 42 years of witnessing what the ugliness of the world looks like, what deception & hate smelled like. Alone, even during the times I thought that I wasnt. 42 years of being So alone, Alone & So very thirtsy. 42 years of waiting.. until I finally got to taste it.. Love, Real Love.. the purest. Most soul quinching thing I have ever consumed in this Life. You. \n",

      "When u get a chance to read this msg. The other night we talked about the opposite sex flirting & making passes & often thru texting. I've been single for so long & unsure how things should work & so I asked u. You said u were just going to trust me, I am greatful. You most definitely Can trust me. I've been thinking & I need to face confrontation because that is The Right way to handle that. Tbh, I most fed would NOT be comfortable with women directly flirting at you & Exsp thru your personal phone line. It rlly is that persons responsibility to speak up & tell the other party that they r currently take & so the gestures are inappropriate at this time & could they plz respect that. There rlly is no question about how that is handled. It is a cut n dry. If \n",

      "Hey, I want to respond to your prior question. \"Flirting thing\" & maybe you Will know that to think about it. If this makes any sense to you at all, it is mostly about me, my personal growth since 2011, my way of thinking & understanding how things do and don't work, in how we treat ppl, handle situations etc.\n",
      "I take alot of pride in making the best decisions, handling situations that ppl commonly face, in the right n proper ways that they should be. Seeing what is right and wrong & being able to find the best course of action is personally vital to me in becoming the person I aim to be & in my end recovery. The choices & decisions I make are one of the most important aspects of my growth. Everytime I know I have handled a matter in my life the right way, that is a huge step ahead for me. The One most important thing that I carry with Me all of the time is the resolve I have made to  =Always do the Next Right thing =. Thru out my days, each time I've done the right thing, made a right choice, was able to see view & logic behind things just the way that I should & just the way that most ppl of aound mind would, each time is a step closer to a break thru & ultimately personal victory. (I am not sure if this makes sense to you) \n",

In the past going to the store with my man it was always something that was dreaded because it was never ever enjoyable nor was it a good experience it didn't matter what man I had in my life at the time. Butt you and me and Dollar General I think was the most enjoyable time I have spent with a man in a store just simply shopping ♡♡♡\n",
      "Yes I am worried about him. No matter what's going on in life there is always some very trying issue with my son and it's usually something serious and emotionally consuming. And I know his mental state and that he still hasn't gotten help and he keeps avoiding getting help so I know the kind of things that would make and break him and when it comes to something that I know it break him it does worry me greatly and this is the first time in my life that he is feeling broken and he's not within Arm's Reach of me.

      "Annie, this is difficult for me to absorb/handle??  I like you, but I just feel like there would be too much unwanted drama to try to have a relationship with you.  It is apparent you need help with things because of your situation.  I totally get that.  You seek help and sollace from a couple, a few? men.  Again, I totally get that.  But you have to understand, I have people that rely on me, people that I love too much.  I can't risk having something happen to me or them.  As such, I can't risk being with you.  I'm sorry, I just don't want to be that guy, that guy that will provide sollace to you, that guy to save you.  You have those guys already.  It's not about jealousy at all, it's about safety and not worrying about some crazy guy that would impose serious drama into the mix.  I really hope you get the help you need to be more independent, both financially and emotionally.  With that all said, I am not judging you, you are a good woman.  I have to think about what's best (and safe) for me and my family.  I know you understand this since you have a beautiful daughter.  I'm sorry Annie, but we should go our separate ways.  Take care Annie.\n",
      "I don't seek solace from cpl few men. I recently allowed myself to be around billy's friends dad twice as he helped me with something\n",
      "I never ever wanted saving\n",
      "You looked into that way too much\n",
      "Yeah, take care. \n",
      "I think u misunderstood most all of that being thru text. Uugh\n",
      "Oh n as far as those screen shots I was honestly looking for help understanding what he was trying to say.\n",
      "This is common, I am completely honest and someone walks\n",
      "I am sorry you thought I was looking for saving\n",
      "Good bye\n",
      "U didn't continue to know me nor be my friend, u ran from the fear of the unknown be for knowing there was anything to rlly be afraid of\n",
      "If I were speaking mostly about my son's friends dad. That was as innocent as ever & all he knows is that I've no interest in dating. He fixed a bike tire and groped off some quaters for me to finish laundry.. when I ran out\n",
      "U said I had a friend, I was talking to u as friends would\n",
      "All before even meeting\n",
      "I am not ting to convince u to change your mind. I do not want that out of a man\n",
      "Is a bummer. I was interested in you Daniel, in a Good and pure way. The way it should be\n",
      "You misunderstood so much here.\n",
      "I looked for friendship first n for most from you. I think this is why so many aboiv complete honesty about themselves, their lives and who they are.. when getting to know someone\n",
      "I think you are going to be missing out on something Very Great. Being me. And a good friendship,.. maybe more someday, I dunno what could have been. But I do know you missed out of me. So I will say good luck and try not to type anymore\n",
      "I respect your wishes. Am disappointed in not having the chance to know you..& in you missing out on who I am. I am sorry that u had concerns, concerns that rlly weren't needed. I still thing u are a beautiful person and wish u well and am sorry we will miss out on that date\n",
      "I still so frustrating that u think I need or am looking for someone to save me.. I never conveyed that is anyway.  *sigh* :( js\n",
      "Annie, sorry I could not reply sooner.  I was at the hospital. Look, I just don't think you're ready to have a relationship.  Yes maybe Im scared of all the things you've been honest about, but who wouldn't be?  I don't want any side drama in my life right now.  Life is too short and my sons depend on me.\n",
      "Fair enough. & I never looked to you or anyone else to save me. Hope all went well with the testing. Take care.\n",
      "And there are some ppl that wouldn't be afraid of someone's past. You are not one of them and that is ok\n",
      "I dont want to be hurt and I dont want to hurt you Annie.  I'm sorry i let you down.\n",
      "That Kevin guy seems like a nice guy though\n",
      "Sorry I was trying to cheer us up, stupid joke\n",
      "He is a very nice guy but I know what I want and he is not it. Been in relationships for the wrong reasons in the past. And my choices are not like they used to be. \n",
      "Yeah thats the pattern I see.  I dont know what you see in me.\n",
      "I don't want to give myself to just somebody or anybody. I am going to give myself to the one who can Rlly see \"Me\". And yeah, nice try anyway.. it's been a rough day.\n",
      "Pattern broke 6 years ago. And I've been alone since waiting for what is right\n",
      "You know what I seen in you & it told me that there was so much more to see. \n",
      "I avoid most all men..have for a long time. Kevin will never be more than a friend. Heis harmless as they come. He is uneducated, has a hard time reading and writing, details cars for a living and is a dad. Prolly one of the \"kindest\" guys I've ever met.\n",
      "Well I blew that up and i think it is weird to ask me about your guy friend.\n",
      "The seemingly harmless are the ones to look out for.\n",
      "If you don't know what I seen in you then maybe u aren't rdy to date.?. Besides, isn't that us what it is about in the end.? Seeing in that someone what they don't see in themselves? That is the Beauty in it\n",
      "Lol yeah most of the time.. but not this one. Kinda reminds me of Lenny from.. of mice and men\n",
      "I'm ready to date, sounds like a challenge to me.\n",
      "Not weird.. that is getting to know someone that is all. If he were someone I was sleeping with maybe wierd (never ever wud happen) but gender should not define a comfort level. \n",
      "You were asking me what I thought about his texts, he def into.\n",
      "*into u\n",
      "Well, I think I am going to give the idea up for now. 5 years ago I decided to be completely honest under all terms and cercumstances. Seems that that is not going to get me very far.. utilizing my life is co.pletely where most think ppl ought to be. & that bothers me. \n",
      "I couldn't make it out.. he was apologizing and I wasn't sure what for (his illiteracy problem makes his texts hard to understand) but Daniel, I would have sent u a text from my sister asking the same thing. There was nothing behind it\n",
      "& eh, I know he is into me. Is why I have handled him in a very distant manner that way. Don't want him thinking there are possibilities with me. \n",
      "I'm no beauty queen but I've spent much of my life turning men the other way.. building barriers. I handle that kind of thing well.\n",
      "Lol i just read something something god u look good something something, i dont mind helping u and your kid something something lol\n",
      "I wish you much luck dating, you deserve someone who will love you the way we all deserved to be loved\n",
      "Yeah. I get that kind of man talk often, & I don't enjoy it nor am I flattered so I avoid those situations as often as possible\n",
      "So you wont reconsider our date if I reconsider you?\n",
      "Dunno. He kept apologizing. I was lost that all. Your a guy, figured u may know what he was meaning\n",
      "You dont want me to read between the lines of what he is really saying lol\n",
      "He is very lonley\n",
      "But c'mon you know\n",
      "Sex ? Sure he would like sex, most men do.. (well we women enjoy it but don't go out looking for it) but no, I think he just rlly wants a full time companion and a happy ever after. Sadly he dosent realize that I am not the one for him \n",
      "Oh.. I know quick and easy if a man's intent is to get me in the sak\n",
      "They guy is a hillbilly & dosent flirt well. He'd been married since he was a teenager.. he is clueless. \"You look good\" is about all he knows \n",
      "Ok so we've said what we have to say, what now?\n",
      "You are still texting me.. \n",
      ":)\n",
      "Yes and Ive asked if you'd reconsider our date.  Im sorry if ive misread you :-)\n",
      "I read that\n",
      "You are.  Am glad you think that.\n",
      "Take care Annie.\n",
      "I would love to meet you in person, have some laughs.. make u smile n blush over n over. showing your dimples\n",
      "Yes, I am awsome. You are awesome\n",
      "Did u leave Daniel ?\n",
      "I think Bob Marley is right, you aint easy, so you must be so right :-)\n",
      "He was right about so many things\n",
      "Am I easy? ;-)\n",
      "I def would like that Date Daniel. But there are a cpl things that I want you to know.. If I may.. ?\n",
      "You ?.. lol. No, you are not easy\n",
      "At this point, why not lol!\n",
      "Lol.. ok\n",
      "Typing\n",
      "You sure know how to drop little bombs on a guy lol\n",
      "I do ?? \n",
      "Just say what you have to say jeeez you trouble-maker ;-)\n",
      "Is all good I get it.. n yeah am typing \n",
      "I have no expectations & I expect nothing from you. Anything u willing give of yourself is an added bonus. There is nothing that I want to take from you, nothing material or overwhelming. Only things you would ever give because you wanted to. \n",
      "There is more\n",
      "I've many obsticles I've had to encounter and one day soon I will cross that finish line. Those obsticles are Mine. I would never try to pull u in nor try to make u feel as if you share my burdens. I do not want you to save me. The things I need to do I need to do on my own.. but if things happened to turn out well, then I'd love to have you by my side as I save myself and reach my level of happiness I am destined for. \n",
      "There is a bit more\n",
      " it is important to me that I let you know these things\n",
      "I am not looking to rush into something with you nor anyone for that matter. Good things happen when they are meant to in the right time. \n",
      "And lastly\n",
      "I would never hurt you Daniel. Nor your Family.. It is not in me. Not with intent nor purpose ever. Not even if I felt you had hurt me. You may not know me well all you have is my words. My words are of great value to me.. Daniel, I am one of the best ppl you will ever meet & that is a promise\n",
      "I wanted you to know these things, as per the conversation earlier. Your comfort and knowing my true intentions is important \n",
      "Ok. I am done ;)\n",
      "And if you are good with that. Yes, I would love that date.. Very M\n",
      "uch !! ♡\n",
      "Annie, you're awesome.  I'm glad to see your words.  I hope you can take care of these burdens.  I can help in what little way i can but at the same time, I don't want you to think that you would be in debt to me in any way, so i hesitate to even help at all.  I think we should just take it one day at a time and not think too much about the future and the unknown.  Someone like me who has a cancer son should have learned this well, but i can sometimes falter, but i try to be back on track.\n",
      "...and yes I am ok with all that. :-)\n",
      "Take one day at a time and not think too much of ther future & the unknown. Yes Daniel..\n",
      "Hey, just to let you know.  His test results may come back right before our date.  If it's bad news, obviously I would have to reschedule, not cancel our date.  There is always a chance I know, but just wanted you to be aware of this possibility.\n",
      "I am so glad that you msgd again today. I rlly am. I wanted to feel upset at you but I just couldnt\n",
      "His results will come back fine. \n",
      "Well you get to be upset at me in person, so there's always that to look forward to :-)\n",
      "And Damn, I am so sorry that you and your son/family have to go thru that :(\n",
      "Would take alot for you to upset me.\n",
      "Thanks.  Yeah unfortunately they dont consider you in \"remission\" until about 5 yrs of scans without signs of cancer.  He has only been cancer free since last Nov.  But we're staying positive and want to live in the moment.  We don't have time for any BS in our lives obviously because of this journey we've been through.  Which is probably why Im selective and overly? cautious.\n",
      "Hey, the last several nights I was actually able to sleep & sleep very well at that, even not remembering falling out. Not common for me at all. Today I was thinking that maybe thay had something to do with talking to you.. and then I thought that :( if that was so.. maybe it was going to go away now.\n",
      "Past Nov ? Nov 2015\n",
      "Yes\n",
      "Seems like a great reason to be selective & cautious\n",
      "Wow.. that is so recent. \n",
      "You 3 boys have sure learned the true value of Life \n",
      "Yeah but i think ppl who havent gone thru this level of adversity still can value life, we just have maybe a different but not necessarily better perspective on life.\n",
      "These words you wrote > I hope you can take care of these burdens.  I can help in what little way i can but at the same time, I don't want you to think that you would be in debt to me in any way, so i hesitate to even help at all.< this is Greatly meaningful. Things like this is why I tell you that it is clear that you are a good man and that my intuition backs that up.\n",
      "Thanks, I'm just saying what's natural to me.  I know that truly altruistic help from others is rare and I know on the receiving end, it is easy to be cynical especially if you've been used before.\n",
      "Im guilty of being cynical, i know i should try to find the good in ppl first but i am not naive.\n",
      "In my recovery it has been very important not to take help, & Exsp from a man. & knowing that if the day I ever do it would be right. = had I take help just because offered I am volnerable to what I may possibly not be seeing. And I need to do what needs done on my own. At least at this point. Plus I am very indipendant. . Never to be one of those women that looks to a man to fix her problems & pay her debts. \n",
      "\"Don't be a woman that needs a man, be a woman that a man needs\"\n",
      "I like that :-)\n",
      "It's hard to trust\n",
      "We should be able to trust until givin a reason not to but in this world we almost can't trust until givin reason to do so\n",
      "So true.\n",
      "Even if i needed help & you offered, I would not take help from you because I would never want you to doubt that I would never use you. \n",
      "Its sad isnt it that we have to think like this in the first place?\n",
      "Lol.. yes, yes it is is ! :D\n",
      "It is nice tho, being an exception to the rest of the world\n",
      "& you are one of the few rare men that hasn't wanted to come at me in some sort of sexual venue\n",
      "(Not that I've anything against sex.. at all) but damn.. that isn't rlly part of getting to know one anothet\n",
      "Yeah it should come later naturally\n",

      "Your boy is going to be ok ya know. So are you. U are going to be ok\n",

      "Makes sense\n",

      "My oldest boy turned 18 in December and February he met a girl and fell in love for the first time. He graduated high school and he moved out. It was last week but yesterday he told me isn't coming home. I know I'm supposed to celebrate this time but for me I feel heartbroken. Just one of life's Stepping Stones\n",
      "Im sorry to hear that.  I hope he isnt too far and can visit later.  I'm sure I'll be sad when my boys leave and are out on their own.  Sounds like my youngest has a girlfriend, we were supposed to do volunteer work together this Sat but he doesnt want me to come, asked why, he said his friend Jamie will be there too.  I was happy that he has a girlfriend even so soon after ending chemo, yet sort of sad that he coming of age and I'm apparently not cool enough to be around his gf.  Kids...<sigh>\n",
      "Oh how I know that feeling lol that is very cute. Is nice to hear from you today\n",
      "Haha yeah I came home and started to cook spaghetti and decided to give you a quick message before I forget about you later on, if that's possible ;-)\n",

      "And by the way your boys are beautiful!!\n",
      "That's ok I was entertaining my dog or perhaps he was entertaining me.  Twice huh?  Sorry to hear.  I hope you havent given up on love or have negative impressions about men.  I was married 18 years and then she left me for a married guy.  But he bailed on her too.  Don't know if it was worth it for her.  Oh well, I've moved on and unfortunately the boys resent her pretty bad.  Its getting better between them though.\n",
      "Oh i hope it's not serious with your son.\n",
      "I typically get shocked reactions from ppl when they learn I have the boys.\n",
      "I too hope that it gets better for your boys with the resentment as any other parent we are the only one that can try to fix the mistakes that they made and make the kids feel OK and safe with their world\n",
      "I find that surprising that you get shot reactions about having boys with you\n",
      "And yes it is very serious with my son probably about as serious as one could possibly imagine. Dating can be tough as the things that I am talking to you openly about a lot of men, choose to see that as baggage or drama to me it is life and everyone has issues and challenges that they face especially when it comes to their children\n",
      "I guess in most cases kids are with their moms in divorces but I dont know.  Its just anecdotal based on ppl's puzzled look or line of questioning.  But my youngest does visit his mom on most Sundays.\n",
      "Oh wow I was hoping it was maybe just custody related, im sorry to hear it is something worse.\n",
      "I view dating daunting, scary maybe?   Its funny I think the pre-cancer me would be so afraid to venture out and experience life.  But after facing my son and telling him he has cancer and that perhaps he could die, that was the scariest thing I have ever felt.  So when Im faced with something \"scary\", I remind myself that is nothing compared to what you had to do last January.  So now at work I am no longer afraid to present or speak in front of others and as for dating, I think i can handle that and whatever baggage that comes with it.  You're right, it is part of life.  I say bring it on.\n",
      "I imagine that it is real tough for you with regards to your son.  If there is any way I can help, I would.   I hope he/you have access to good legal counsel.\n",

      "As for the dating scene yes it is quite interesting to say the least exsp at our age. So many people are just completely broken and try to convince themselves that they are not. They don't seem to understand that healing is a necessity and that it takes time. So in turn they knowingly and at times unknowingly pour that on to an unexpecting hopeful\n",
      "When my marriage ended in early 2011-12. LOL I can't keep track. Dating was not on the top of my priority list Getting to Know Myself and bettering Who I Am Was. So I stayed single I did date what are rare occasion usually being somebody that I already knew. It was only through this past year that I decided to attempt. Still haven't dated much. Although my life is not perfect I also know what I am capable of giving and what I am deserving of and I just don't have time to waste on anything less than that. On top of that building a friendship and getting to know someone is the foundation. People should do their best to avoid skipping that. Not too many people seem to understand this\n",
      "I agree.  Yeah, Ive been seeing a therapist at my cousin's recommendation, he's been great.  Its only been phone sessions, he's in North Carolina.  With the divorce and son's cancer soon afterwards my cousin was worried and so she referred me to her therapist.  He actually is amazed at how well Ive held up.  He said most men in my situation do not fare well.  We talked about healing first.\n",
      "I also didn't find it fair to unload my garbage onto someone else. Nor did I want to go into any type of relationship being needy or codependent. I needed to find the strength to depend on myself emotionally before I was able to find the ability to allow someone to depend on me at all\n",

      "I cant pretend to know what you went through but it sounds right that you needed to heal.  From what you have told me so far, you went through some tough stuff beyond what I would ever know.  Im sorry you had these experiences, but hopefully you can and have recovered to enjoy life again.\n",

      "Haha that's too funny.  I actually dont know enough about PTSD to be afraid.  Should I be?\n",
      "So if this evening when you are settled to relax maybe we can attempt that and/or another time\n",
      "No you should not be afraid LOL but there is such a stigma it out there\n",
      "Hey you dont have to, take your time.  I would not want you to do something you're not comfortable with.  Patience is a virtue I try to work on.\n",
      "I hope that you won't be afraid because if you chose to you I think both of us might miss out\n",

So my son is sent off to live with a sex offender dad (who lives with an alcoholic relative ) instead of with his lovibg mother, with a good clean stable home and able empty bedroom for him. \n",

      "You still have custody of your daughter right?\n",
      "It is like you tell me how you don't understand how such things could happen.. innocent children.. suffer & battle illnesses.. it's everywhere in so many ways. A system letting a child Live.. lives that are so bad that they wish thier lives were taken. \n",
      "Yes that is why Ive lost my faith.  But doesnt mean you should or will.\n",
      "When my 2nd ex went to war he said he wanted a divorce.. it was at thay time we discovered the PTSD.

      ":)\n",
      "Ty for listening\n",
      "Yw, you're probably wondering what im thinking.  Im just stunned.  Not sure if you are reaching out for help or understanding or wanting someone to listen to your concerns.  I wish i could do more for you instead of words that won't change things for you.  Feeling of helplessness sucks. :-(\n",
      "I wish I could provide some advice for you.  This isnt something I am knowledgable in.  I don't know of any good lawyers.  I just know divorce lawyers and they seem crummy too.  From what you're telling me, it would seem the most immediate concern would be about your son.  I mean he tried to commit suicide.  That's pretty serious.  Who's to say he won't try again?  This is really sad.\n",
